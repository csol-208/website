Registration for ESPM-157 follows the campus staged process with reserved seats for several of the specific majors in the host department (ESPM) as determined by Rasser College of Natural Resources (RCNR) scheduling and academic advising staff. All seats go quickly, so please plan to enroll as soon as you are eligible to do so. Students in ESPM-based majors should speak to their major adviser about enrolling in ESPM-157 and reserved seats. Please do not contact course instructors about permission to enroll or enrollment codes for reserved seats, this process is handled by RCNR Scheduling to be as fair and equitable as possible across student groups needing this course to meet graduation requirements. We are constantly exploring ways to expand access to this course without degrading the educational experience. Graduate students interested in 157 should consider ESPM 288, usually offered each Spring."

    "text": "Format and assessment\n\nThis course centers around our in-class experience. We meet for 2 hours twice a week for a hands-on, group-based experience facilitated by your instructors. Lectures will not be recorded because there will not be lectures. Built on decades of education research and delivered in the most recent state-of-the art Active Learning Classroom on campus, this course emphasizes a collaborative learning-by-doing approach in all elements. Today, there are a wealth of lectures in data science that can be viewed freely without a university tuition. Education research shows the value of hands-on, peer based experience which we have the opportunity to create in our classroom. We recognize that things happen and students will not be penalized if they cannot make a session\nThe course is built on four open-ended modules and final project. In each, students will work in pairs (and occassionally individually) to replicate or refute the main scientific findings of a key paper or result in global change ecology. Each module is selected to introduce a core set of competencies in data science, fundamental concepts in global change ecology, and new skills for reproducible research and data-driven communication."

It is expected that students in this course will have a wide range of prior experience and ability, and grading will aim to reflect learning and effort in the course. This course is not graded “on a curve” compared to other students. Grades will reflect relative individual learning and improvement from earlier benchmarks. It is certainly possible for all students to receive high grades in this course if all of you show mastery of the material and completely attempt all assignments. However, high competency that does not reflect learning gains or the stylistic expectations of this course may score quite poorly. Our course prizes concise, semantic code supported by clear and insightful text and figures.\nAll assignments are due by immediately before the start of class on the day indicated. Assignments should be submitted as instructed."

This policy is based on the idea that in order to learn how to use computers well, students should be working with them at multiple times each week. Time has been allotted in class for working on assignments and students are expected to work on them outside of class. It is intended that you should have finished as much of the assignment as you can based on what we have covered in class by the following class period. Therefore, even if something unexpected happens at the last minute you should already be close to done with the assignment. This policy also allows rapid feedback to be provided to students by returning assignments quickly."

Please identify your collaborators by name on all assignments.\nSince you’re working collaboratively, keep your project partner and the course instructor informed. If some medical or personal emergency takes you away from the course for an extended period, or if you decide to drop the course for any reason, please don’t just disappear silently! You should inform your project partner, so that nobody is depending on you to do something you can’t finish."
